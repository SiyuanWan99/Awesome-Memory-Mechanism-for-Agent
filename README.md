## 🌟 What you’ll find here
- 📚 Curated paper lists and surveys  
- 🔧 Open-source implementations  
- 🧪 Demos, benchmarks, and reproducible experiments  

## 🙌 Join us
Feel free to **star ⭐, fork 🍴** — whether you are here to learn, share, or just explore.  
We believe that **science grows when knowledge is open**. Everyone is welcome to study, tinker, and contribute!

-- **Parametric Memory**  :zap:
- 
  Stored inside the model parameters (e.g., weights of neural networks). Used for long-term knowledge learned during training.

-- **Non-Parametric Memory**  :zap:
- 
  External memory components that can be queried dynamically.  
  Examples: key-value stores, retrieval databases, vector indices.

-- **Working Memory (Short-Term Memory)**  :zap:
- 
  Temporary storage during task execution, like KV-Cache in transformers.  
  Keeps recent context for reasoning and decision-making.

-- **Episodic Memory (Long-Term Memory)**  :zap:
- 
  Stores agent’s past experiences or trajectories.  
  Useful for reflection, meta-learning, and long-term adaptation.

-- **Semantic / Knowledge Graph Memory**  :zap:
- 
  Structured memory in the form of graphs or databases.  
  Helps encode relationships and facts for reasoning.

-- **Personal vs. System Memory**  :zap:
- 
  - *Personal memory*: specific to one agent (preferences, history).  
  - *System memory*: shared across multiple agents or the environment.

## :books: Purpose of This Repository
This repository is a collection of academic papers, surveys, and implementations about **memory mechanisms in intelligent agents**. It aims to help researchers and practitioners quickly locate resources on how agents **store, recall, and utilize memory** for reasoning and decision-making.
