# :robot::brain: Memory-Mechanism in Agent Field / Remote Sensing Agent  
The Memory-Mechanism in Agent Field can be devided to different kinds of memeory.\\\:zap:

-- **Parametric Memory**  :zap:
- 
  Stored inside the model parameters (e.g., weights of neural networks). Used for long-term knowledge learned during training.

-- **Non-Parametric Memory**  :zap:
- 
  External memory components that can be queried dynamically.  
  Examples: key-value stores, retrieval databases, vector indices.

-- **Working Memory (Short-Term Memory)**  :zap:
- 
  Temporary storage during task execution, like KV-Cache in transformers.  
  Keeps recent context for reasoning and decision-making.

-- **Episodic Memory**  :zap:
- 
  Stores agent’s past experiences or trajectories.  
  Useful for reflection, meta-learning, and long-term adaptation.

-- **Semantic / Knowledge Graph Memory**  :zap:
- 
  Structured memory in the form of graphs or databases.  
  Helps encode relationships and facts for reasoning.

-- **Personal vs. System Memory**  :zap:
- 
  - *Personal memory*: specific to one agent (preferences, history).  
  - *System memory*: shared across multiple agents or the environment.
